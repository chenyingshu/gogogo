## Welcome to _Gogogo!_ Project Homepage

This is the basic introduction of our project, including our data collection, filtering, recommendation, path planning, visualization, and final validation trip.

### Introduction
In this project, we will finish a one-day trip planning with public data and data-driven algorithms.

Basically, our system encloses four main steps:
1. [Public Data Collection](#1-data-collection)
2. Destination Recommendation 
3. Path Planning
4. Interactive Path Visualization

### 1. Data Collection
#### Nearby Area Search
We roughly figure out nearby areas (e.g., based on transportations) around the target traveling area.

For example, to explore candidate areas around _Kwun Tong Line_, we have these candidates:
<!-- ![Area candidates](./img/1_1_location_candidates.png) -->
<img src="./img/1_1_location_candidates.png" alt="Area candidates" width="60%" height="auto" >
